## Introduction

A fascinating and important question that arises in the field of urban safety is how weather affects homicide rates. This question has implications for law enforcement tactics, resource allocation, policy formulation, community readiness, and criminology academic advancement.

The relationship between weather and homicides is complex and influenced by a number of indirect factors. Increased hostility and irritability have been associated with higher temperatures, which may make violent conflicts more likely. Seasonal differences in the weather can also affect outdoor activities. Unfavourable weather may discourage people from going outside, which would reduce the likelihood of conflicts. Seasonal variations in daylight availability have an impact on the visibility of crime and longer daylight hours may serve as a deterrent when criminal activity becomes more obvious. Social interactions are further affected by the possibility of confrontations that could turn violent due to the tendency of specific weather patterns to promote outdoor gatherings. Extended periods of unfavourable weather, including intense rain or extremely high temperatures, can also have a detrimental impact on mental health and criminal behaviour. Even though these correlations have been noted, it's important to recognize how complex the link is because a number of social, economic, and environmental elements work together to influence crime rates. Determining direct causality is still difficult and necessitates a sophisticated comprehension of the complex dynamics involved.

To examine the impact of weather on homicides, this paper is organized into the following sections: Data, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion.  In the Data section, I discuss the nature of the spreadsheet obtained through the City of Toronto’s OpenDataToronto Library [@rOpenDataToronto] and the steps I took to clean and analyze the data. The Results section highlights trends found during the analysis process, while the Discussion section further evaluates the trends and presents insight. Lastly, the Conclusion section summarizes the main findings from this paper. 


## Data

The data utilized throughout this paper was obtained through the City of Toronto’s OpenDataToronto Library [@rOpenDataToronto]. The data set used is entitled ' Police Annual Statistical Report - Homicides' [@HomicideStatistics]. Data was collected and analyzed using the statistical programming software R [@r], with additional support from `tidyverse` [@rTidyverse], `ggplot2` [@rGgplot2], `dplyr` [@rDplyr], `readr` [@rReadr], `tibble` [@rTibble], `janitor` [@rJanitor], `KableExtra` [@rKableExtra], `knitr` [@rknitr], `ggbeeswarm` [@rggbeeswarm], `ggrepel` [@rggrepel], and `here` [@rHere]. A further discussion of the data collection, cleaning, and analysis process can be found later on in this paper. 

### Toronto Homicide Statistics
This dataset, published by Toronto Police [@HomicideStatistics] outlines Homicide statistics in the city of Toronto. For each homicide, the data is divided into three types, which are: Shooting, Stabbing and Other. The data also shows the date on which these homicides were committed. For this study, I will be focusing on the broad month of the incident so we can use weather data[@TorontoWeather] to classify the homicide as a warm weather homicide or a cold weather homicide. 

Upon analysis, I only used columns that indicated homicide type and month of occurrence. All other columns were deemed beyond the scope of this paper. I conducted the first step of basic data cleaning to eliminate additional columns and simplify the names of retained columns and grouped the homicides by months. (see @tbl-cleaned_monthly_data).

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-cleaned_monthly_data
#| tbl-cap: Sample of Cleaned Homicide Statistics Data

head (cleaned_monthly_data, 5) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Month", "Homicide Data"),
  booktabs = TRUE
  )
```
### Division of Homicides

The Toronto Homicide Statistics data set [@HomicideStatistics] divides the Homicides into 3 subcategories, which are: Shootings, Stabbings and Other. Consequently, I wrote a script using 'group_by' to see the total count of homicides for each subcategory (see @tbl-HomicideData). 
We now want to categorize the months as "warm" or "cold" to categorize a homicides that occurred 
in a warm month or a cold month. According to Toronto temperature history [@TorontoWeather],
Toronto has experienced cooler weather in the months of October through March and warm weather in the months April through September

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-HomicideData
#| tbl-cap: Sample of Cleaned Categorized Homicide Data

head (cleaned_categorized_data, 5) |>
    kable(
        col.names = c("Homicide Category", "Count"),
        booktabs = TRUE
    )
```

### Categorize Homicide by Temperature

Since I now had a basis and metric to classify how the warm weather homicides and cold weather homicides will be categorized, I cleaned the existing data and created a data table using "group_by" with homicides for the warm months(see @tbl-cleaned_warm_data) and repeated the process for the cold months(see @tbl-cleaned_cold_data).

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-cleaned_warm_data
#| tbl-cap: Homicide Data for Warm Months[April - September]

head (cleaned_warm_homicide_data) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Homicide", "Count"),
  booktabs = TRUE
  )
```
```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-cleaned_cold_data
#| tbl-cap: Homicide Data for Cold Months[October - March]

head (cleaned_cold_homicide_data) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Homicide", "Count"),
  booktabs = TRUE
  )
```

## Results

### Monthly Homicide Data 

As evident from the insights obtained in @tbl-cleaned_monthly_data2, notable patterns emerge. Referencing @TorontoWeather, we can discern that July stands out as one of the hottest months in Toronto over the last two decades, while conversely, January registers as one of the coldest. Corroborating this meteorological data with homicide statistics reveals a corresponding trend, with July exhibiting a higher incidence of homicides, while January records a comparatively lower frequency. For a visual representation of these observations, please consult @fig-monthly_statistics, which encapsulates the physical manifestation of the data trends.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-cleaned_monthly_data2
#| tbl-cap: Homicide Data for Every Month across 20 years

head (cleaned_monthly_data, 12) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Month", "Homicides"),
  booktabs = TRUE
  )
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-monthly_statistics
#| fig-cap: Number of Homicide Incidents per month from 2004 to 2023.

ggplot(cleaned_monthly_data, aes(x = occ_month, y= responses)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill='blue') +
  xlab("Months") +
  ylab("Homicide Incidents")  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

### Affect of weather on Homicide Incidents

A detailed analysis of seasonal data is necessary to determine whether there is a relationship between weather and homicide incidents. A strong pattern emerges by comparing the analysis of @tbl-cold_data, which represents the colder months of October to March, with @tbl-warm_data, which includes homicide incidences from April to September between 2004 and 2023. There is a distinct decrease in homicide events of all kinds (Shootings, Stabbings, Other) throughout the winter months, but a substantial increase during the hotter months. This glaring discrepancy suggests a direct link between rising homicide rates and warmer temperatures.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-warm_data
#| tbl-cap: Homicide Incidents from April through September from 2004-2023

head (cleaned_warm_homicide_data) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Homicide Subcategory", "Incidents"),
  booktabs = TRUE
  )
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-cold_data
#| tbl-cap: Homicide Incidents from October through March from 2004-2023

head (cleaned_cold_homicide_data) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Homicide Subcategory", "Incidents"),
  booktabs = TRUE
  )
```

We now look at the homicide data from both types of weather side by side in @tbl-both_months and can see that warm weather has an increase in all types of homicides. We can also see this graphically depicted in Figure 2

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-both_months
#| tbl-cap: Comparing Homicide Data for Warm Weather and Cold Weather

head (cleaned_comparing_data) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Homicide Type", "Cold Weather", "Warm Weather"),
  booktabs = TRUE
  )
```

## Conclusion
Our thorough examination of Toronto homicide statistics has revealed significant insights into the patterns of criminal behaviour in the city. One important finding is that warmer temperature correlates with a higher rate of homicides than cooler weather. While determining direct causation is difficult, this pattern is consistent with previous research indicating that higher temperatures may contribute to increased aggression and social tensions[@WeatherAndCrime]. Furthermore, warmer weather frequently leads to more social contacts and outdoor activities, which can create situations that foster conflict and escalate into violent occurrences. These findings highlight the complex relationship between weather patterns and crime, stressing the significance of taking environmental elements into account when analyzing and managing urban safety issues.
